This is a native Windows app for stream aggregation and notifications, in the vein of the browser extensions that do the same job.

I initially made it to track some streams of other games, that weren't listed on the clg site.

Some notes:

You can search by stream or game name by typing while the window is selected.

In the title bar you can filter the 4 games by clicking on the icons.
When a icon is green, only streams of that game are listed.
If a icon is red, and there are no green-lighted games, those streams will be removed from the overall listing. Clicking on the streams tab while it is already active toggles the streams list with an unfiltered list. 

You can also hide a game by its name in the config tab, values are comma separated and make a partial match.
